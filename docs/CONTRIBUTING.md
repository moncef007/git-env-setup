## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `build`: Build system changes
- `revert`: Revert previous commit

### Scope

The scope should be the area affected:
- `config`: Git configuration files
- `hooks`: Git hooks
- `scripts`: Helper scripts
- `docs`: Documentation
- `build`: Build system (Makefile)

### Examples

```bash
feat(hooks): add syntax validation to pre-commit
fix(scripts): resolve git-cleanup error on Windows
docs(aliases): add examples for rebase workflow
refactor(config): consolidate color configurations
test(hooks): add unit tests for commit-msg validation
```

### Rules

1. **Subject line:**
   - Use imperative mood: "add" not "added"
   - Don't capitalize first letter
   - No period at the end
   - Maximum 72 characters

2. **Body:**
   - Wrap at 100 characters
   - Explain what and why, not how
   - Use bullet points for multiple changes

3. **Footer:**
   - Reference issues: `Fixes #123`
   - Note breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: ...`

### Complete Example

```
feat(hooks): add branch name validation to pre-push

- Validate branch naming convention (type/description)
- Support multiple branch types (feature, bugfix, hotfix)
- Add bypass option with user confirmation
- Include helpful error messages with examples

This prevents poorly named branches from being pushed
and maintains consistency across the team.

Closes #45
Refs #38
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Test individual components
bash -n hooks/pre-commit        # Syntax check
shellcheck hooks/pre-commit     # Linting
```

### Adding Tests

When adding new features:

1. **Add syntax validation** to `make test`
2. **Test edge cases** manually
3. **Document test scenarios** in PR description

### Manual Testing Checklist

For hooks:
- [ ] Test with valid scenarios
- [ ] Test with invalid scenarios
- [ ] Test bypass functionality
- [ ] Test on multiple OS (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- [ ] Test error messages are clear

For scripts:
- [ ] Test with various inputs
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test help output
- [ ] Verify no side effects

For config:
- [ ] Test aliases work as expected
- [ ] Verify no conflicts with common aliases
- [ ] Test on fresh Git installation

## Documentation

### Documentation Standards

- **Clear and concise**: Easy to understand
- **Examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Up-to-date**: Update docs with code changes
- **Well-organized**: Logical structure

### What to Document

When adding features, update:

1. **README.md**: If it affects installation or usage
2. **Specific docs**: HOOKS.md, etc.
3. **Inline comments**: Complex code sections
4. **Commit messages**: Comprehensive explanations


### Best Practices

1. **Error handling**: Always check return codes
2. **User feedback**: Provide clear messages
3. **Colors**: Use consistently (red=error, yellow=warning, green=success)
4. **Compatibility**: Test on Bash 4+ and Zsh
5. **Documentation**: Comment non-obvious code

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check docs/ directory
- **Issues**: Search existing issues
- **Discussions**: GitHub Discussions
- **Questions**: Open an issue with "question" label
